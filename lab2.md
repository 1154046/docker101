# Overview

In this lab, we build on our knowledge from lab 1. We will create a custom Docker Image built from a Dockerfile. Once we build the image, we will push it to a central registry where it can be pulled to be deployed on other environments. Also, we will briefly describe image layers, and how Docker incorporates "copy-on-write" and the union file system to efficiently store images and run containers.

## Prerequisites

You must have docker installed, or be using http://play-with-docker.com

# Step 1: Create a python app (without using Docker)

1. Create `app.py` with the following contents

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "hello world!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

This is a simple python app that uses flask to expose a http web server on port 5000. Don't worry if you are not too familiar with python or flask, these concepts can be applied to an application written in any language.

**Optional:** If you have python and pip installed, you can run this app locally. If not, move on to the next step.

```sh
$ python --version
Python 2.7.13
$ pip --version
pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
$ pip install flask
Requirement already satisfied: python in /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload
$ python app.py 
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

# Step 2: Create and build the Docker Image

If you don't have python install locally, don't worry! Because you don't need it. One of the advantages of using Docker containers is that you can build python into your containers, without having python installed on your host. 

1. Create a `Dockerfile` with the following contents
```sh
FROM python:2.7-alpine
RUN pip install flask
CMD ["python","app.py"]
COPY app.py /app.py
```

A Dockerfile lists the instructions needed to build a docker image. Let's go through the above file line by line.

**FROM python:2.7-alpine**
This is the starting point for your Dockerfile. Every Dockerfile must start with a `FROM` line that is the starting image to build your layers on top of. In this case, we are selecting the `python:2.7-alpine` base layer since it already has the version of python and pip that we need to run our application. The `alpine` version means that it uses the alpine distribution, which is significantly smaller than an alternative flavor of linux. A smaller image means it will download (deploy) much faster, and it also has advantages for security because it has a smaller attack surface.

Here we are using the "2.7-alpine" tag for the python image. Take a look at the available tags for the official python image on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/). It is best practice to use a specific tag when inheriting a parent image so that changes to the parent dependency are controlled. We can even go one step further to specify the "2.17.13-alpine" tag to protect ourselves even more. If no tag is specified, the "latest" tag takes into effect, which is acts as a dynamic pointer that points to the latest version of an image. 

For security reasons, it is very important to understand the layers that you build your docker image on top of. For that reason, it is highly recommended to only use "official" images found in the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/), or non-community images found in the docker-store. These images are vetted to meet certain security requirements, and also have very good documentation for users to follow. You can find more information about this [python base image](https://store.docker.com/images/python), as well as all other images that you can use, on the [docker store](https://store.docker.com/).

For a more complex application you may find the need to use a`FROM` image that is higher up the chain. For example, the parent [ Dockerfile](https://github.com/docker-library/python/blob/cd1f11aa745a05ddf6329678d5b12a097084681b/2.7/alpine/Dockerfile) for our python app  starts with `FROM alpine`, then specifies a series of `CMD` and `RUN` commands for the image. If you needed more fine-grained control, you could start with `FROM alpine` (or a different distribution) and run those steps yourself. To start off though, I recommend using an official image that closely matches your needs.

**RUN pip install flask**
Use the `RUN` command to execute commands needed to set up your image for your application, such as installing packages, editing files, or changing file permissions. In this case we are installing flask. The `RUN` commands are executed at build time, and are added to the layers of your image. 

**CMD ["python","app.py"]**
`CMD` (not to be confused with `RUN`) is the command that is executed when you start a container. Here we are using `CMD` to run our python app. 

There can be only one `CMD` per Dockerfile. If you specify more thane one `CMD`, then the last `CMD` will take effect. The parent python:2.7-alpine also specifies a `CMD` (`CMD python2`). You can find the Dockerfile for the official python:alpine image (here) [https://github.com/docker-library/python/blob/cd1f11aa745a05ddf6329678d5b12a097084681b/2.7/alpine/Dockerfile]. 

You can use the official python image directly to run python scripts without installing python on your host. But today, we are creating a custom image to include our source, so that we can build an image with our application and ship it around to other environments.

**COPY app.py /app.py**
This copies the app.py in the local directory (where you will run `docker image build`) into a new layer of the image. It seems counter-intuitive to put this after the `CMD ["python","app.py"]` line. Remember, the `CMD` line is executed only when the container is started, so we won't get a `file not found` error here. Ordering the Dockerfile in this way takes advantage of the layer cache, which we will demonstrate a little later in this lab.

And there you have it: a very simple Dockerfile. A full list of commands you can put into a Dockerfile can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). Now that we defined our Dockerfile, let's use it to build our custom docker image.

2. Build the docker image. 

Pass in `-t` to name your image `python-hello-world`.

```sh
$ docker image build -t python-hello-world .

Verify that your image shows up in your image list via `docker image ls`.

```sh
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
python-hello-world         latest              9c7a01569645        4 seconds ago       83.4MB
python              2.7-alpine          29c1b4c9b149        3 days ago          72MB
```

Notice that your base image, python:2.7-alpine, is also in your list.

# Step 3: Run the Docker image

Now that you have built the image, you can run it to see that it works.

1. Run the Docker image
```sh
$ docker run -p 5001:5000 -d python-hello-world
d47d0c97f5d8df5e5f978fbfde12094c6611a8fd4286897804ea8b8dce3c724e
```

The `-p` flag maps a port running inside the container to your host. In this case, we are mapping the python app running on port 5000 inside the container, to port 5001 on your host. Note that if port 5001 is already in use by another application on your host, you may have to replace 5001 with another value, such as 5002.

2. Navigate to http://localhost:5001 in a browser to see the results

You should see "Hello World" on your browser.

3. Check the log output of the container.

If you want to see logs from your application you can use the `docker container logs` command. By default, `docker container logs` prints out what is sent to standard out by your application.
```sh
$ docker container logs [container id] # Use 'docker container ls' to find the id for your running container
Server running at http://localhost:4000
```

The Dockerfile is how you create reproducible builds for your application. A common workflow is to have your CI/CD automation run `docker image build` as part of its build process. Once images are built, they will be sent to a central registry, where it can be accessed by all environments (such as a test environment) that need to run instances of that application. In the next step, we will push our custom image to the public docker registry: the docker hub, where it can be consumed by other developers and operators.


# Step 4: Push to a central registry

1. Navigate to https://hub.docker.com and create an account if you haven't already

For this lab we will be using the docker hub as our central registry. Docker hub is a free service to store publicly available images, or you can pay to store private images. Go to the [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) website and create a free account.

Most organizations that use docker heavily will set up their own registry internally. To simplify things, we will be using the Docker Hub, but the following concepts apply to any registry.

2. Login

You can log into hte docker registry account by typing `docker login` on your terminal.

``` 
$ docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: 
```

2. Tag your image with your username

The Docker Hub naming convention is to tag your image with [dockerhub username]/[image name]. To do this, we are going to tag our previously created image `python-hello-world` to fit that format.

```sh
$ docker tag python-hello-world [your dockerhub username]/python-hello-world
```

3. Push your image to the registry

Once we have a properly tagged image, we can use the `docker push` command to push our image to the Docker Hub registry.

```sh
$ docker push [your dockerhub username]/python-hello-world
The push refers to a repository [docker.io/jzaccone/python-hello-world]

```

4. Check out your image on docker hub in your browser

Navigate to https://hub.docker.com and go to your profile to see your newly uploaded image.

Now that your image is on Docker Hub, other developers and operations can use the `docker pull` command to deploy your image to other environments.  

**Note:** Docker images contain all the dependencies that it needs to run an application within the image. This is useful because we no longer have deal with environment drift (version differences) when we rely on dependencies that are install on every environment we deploy to. We also don't have to go through additional steps to provision these environments. Just one step: install docker, and you are good to go.

# Step 5: Deploying a Change
The "Hello World" application is overrated, let's update the app so that it says "Hello Beautiful World!" instead.

1. Update `app.py`

Replace the string "Hello World" with "Hello Beautiful World!" in `app.py`. Your file should have the following contents:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello Beautiful World!"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

2. Rebuild and push your image

Now that your app is updated, you need repeat the steps above to rebuild your app and push it to the Docker Hub registry.

First rebuild, this time use your Docker Hub username in the build command.:


```sh
$ docker image build -t [dockerhub username]/python-hello-world .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  33.28kB
Step 1/4 : FROM python:2.7-alpine

 ---> 32ecbd8b73f2
Removing intermediate container c7f5e1c62338
Successfully built 32ecbd8b73f2
Successfully tagged jzaccone/python-hello-world:latest
```

Notice the "Using cache" for steps 1-3. These layers of the Docker Image have already been built and `docker image build` will use these layers from the cache instead of rebuilding them.

```sh
$ docker push [dockerhub username]/python-hello-world
The push refers to a repository [docker.io/jzaccone/python-hello-world]
cc3cdc4631a0: Pushed 
91c3b6a99b35: Layer already exists 
ea6fb20ac5c0: Layer already exists 
24b5c72b5972: Layer already exists 
590266e37bf8: Layer already exists 
ba2cc2690e31: Layer already exists 
latest: digest: sha256:0c281ad8e259ce1edc3ad67163c08c93039c9916a690da72c0f4aa79cba8163c size: 1579
```

There is a caching mechanism in place for pushing layers too. Docker Hub already has all but one of the layers from an earlier push, so it only pushes the one layer that has changed.

When you change a layer, every layer built on top of that will have to be rebuilt. Each line in a Dockerfile builds a new layer that is built on the layer created from the lines before it. This is why the order of the lines in our Dockerfile is important. We optimized our Dockerfile so that the layer that is most likely to change (`COPY app.py /app.py`) is the last line of the Dockerfile. Generally for an application, your code changes at the most frequent rate. This optimization is particularly important for CI/CD processes, where you want your automation to run as fast as possible.

# Step 6: Understanding Image Layers

One of the major design properties of Docker is its use of the union file system. 

Consider the Dockerfile that we created before: 
```sh
FROM python:2.7-alpine
RUN pip install flask
CMD ["python","app.py"]
COPY app.py /app.py
```

Each of these lines is a layer. Each layer contains only the delta, or changes from the layers before it. To put these layers together into a single running container, Docker makes use of the union file system to overlay layers transparently into a single view.

Each layer of the image is read-only, except for the very top layer which is created for the container. The read/write container layer implements "copy-on-write" which means that files that are stored in lower image layers are pulled up to the read/write container layer only when edits are being made to those files. Those changes are then stored in the container layer. The "copy-on-write" function is very fast, and in almost all cases, does not have a noticeable effect on performance.

![](/images/lab2_understanding_image_layers_1.png)

Since image layers are read-only, they can be shared by images and by running containers. For instance, creating a new python app with its own Dockerfile with similar base layers, would share all the layers that it had in common with the first python app.

```sh
FROM python:2.7-alpine
RUN pip install flask
CMD ["python","app.py"]
COPY app2.py /app2.py
```

![](/images/lab2_understanding_image_layers_2.png)

You can also experience the sharing of layers when you start multiple containers from the same image. Since the containers use the same read-only layers, you can imagine that starting up containers is very fast and has a very low footprint on the host.

Image layering enables the docker caching mechanism for builds and pushes. For example, the output for your last `docker push` shows that some of the layers of your image already exists on the Docker Hub.
```sh
$ docker push [dockerhub username]/python-hello-world
The push refers to a repository [docker.io/jzaccone/python-hello-world]
cc3cdc4631a0: Pushed 
91c3b6a99b35: Layer already exists 
ea6fb20ac5c0: Layer already exists 
24b5c72b5972: Layer already exists 
590266e37bf8: Layer already exists 
ba2cc2690e31: Layer already exists 
latest: digest: sha256:0c281ad8e259ce1edc3ad67163c08c93039c9916a690da72c0f4aa79cba8163c size: 1579
```

To look more closely at layers, you can use the `docker image history` command of the python image we created.

```sh
$ docker image history python-hello-world
IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                                      SIZE                COMMENT

```

Each line represents a layer of the image. You'll notice that the top lines match to your Dockerfile that you created, and the lines below are pulled from the parent python image. Don't worry about the "\<missing\>" tags. These are still normal layers; they have just not been given an ID by the docker system.

# Step 7: Clean up

Completing this lab results in a bunch of running containers on your host. Let's clean these up.

1. Run `docker container stop [container id]` for each container that is running

First get a list of the containers running using `docker container ls`.
```sh
$ $ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
2b2eb7b04444        python-hello-world   "python app.py"     6 minutes ago       Up 6 minutes        0.0.0.0:5001->5000/tcp   eloquent_khorana
```
Then run `docker container stop [container id]` for each container in the list.
```sh
$ docker container stop 2b2
2b2
```

2. Remove the stopped containers

`docker system prune` is a really handy command to clean up your system. It will remove any stopped containers, unused volumes and networks, and dangling images.

```sh
$ docker system prune
WARNING! This will remove:
        - all stopped containers
        - all volumes not used by at least one container
        - all networks not used by at least one container
        - all dangling images

# Summary

In this lab, you started adding value by creating your own custom docker containers. 

Key Takeaways:
- The Dockerfile is how you create reproducible builds for your application and how you integrate your application with Docker into the CI/CD pipeline
- Docker images can be made available to all of your environments through a central registry. The Docker Hub is one example of a registry, but you can deploy your own registry on servers you control.
- Docker images contain all the dependencies that it needs to run an application within the image. This is useful because we no longer have deal with environment drift (version differences) when we rely on dependencies that are install on every environment we deploy to.
- Docker makes use of the union file system and "copy on write" to reuse layers of images. This lowers the footprint of storing images and significantly increases the performance of starting containers.
- Image layers are cached by the Docker build and push system. No need to rebuild or repush image layers that are already present on the desired system.
- Each line in a Dockerfile creates a new layer, and because of the layer cache, the lines that change more frequently (e.g. adding source code to an image) should be listed near the bottom of the file.
